# Overview

<p align="center">
The cyber kill chain is an intrusion model developed by Lockheed Martin in 2011, based on the kill chain military model, which displays the necessary stages for a successful attack. The cyber kill chain breaks down the seven stages that an attacker may go through to accomplish their intrusion objectives. As a defender, this model provides a framework for placing obstacles at each step of the attacker's cyber intrusion attempt. Incorporating the cyber kill chain into an organization's defense posture can provide a robust defense against attackers with TTP's that follow the stages of the kill chain. This model is not inclusive of all TTP's in use by attackers and should not be regarded as a monolithic structure for all attacks.
